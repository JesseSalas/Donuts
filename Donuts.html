<p>A donut is a type of <mark class="mark">deep fried</mark> dough confectionery or <br>
  dessert food. The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in
  various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased
  in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty
  outlets.</p>

<p class="Fact">Did you know? Donut can also be spelled "doughnut."</p>

<p>The two most common types are the <b class="bold">toroidal ring doughnut</b> and <br>
  the <b>filled doughnut</b>-which is injected with fruit preserves, <br>
  cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. A small spherical piece <br>
  of dough may be cooked as a doughnut hole. Other shapes include <br>
  rings, balls, and flattened spheres, as well as ear shapes, <br>
  twists and other forms. Doughnut varities are also divided into <br>
  cake and risen type doughnuts.</p>
